## Message 1: Immediate Follow-Up (Within 5 minutes of missed call)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Missed you – Let's reschedule your roof quote

Hi [First Name],

I just tried calling you at [Phone Number] for our [Time] appointment, but couldn't get through.

No worries – I know life gets busy!

**Want to reschedule?**

I've still got your property pulled up on our satellite imaging and I'm ready to give you that preliminary quote whenever suits you best.

Pick a new time here: [CALENDAR LINK]

Or if now's actually a good time, just call me back: **0412 517 411**

I'll hold your spot open for the next 24 hours.

Talk soon,
Luke

## Message 2: Value Reminder (4 hours later)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Still interested in your roof quote?

Hi [First Name],

Following up from earlier – I tried calling for your preliminary roof quote but we didn't connect.

I wanted to make sure you're still interested because storm season is coming up, and getting ahead of Queensland weather is smart.

**Here's what you're missing out on:**

✓ **10-minute satellite quote** – No need for me to visit yet, I can give you a ballpark figure
✓ **Transparent pricing** – What we quote is what you pay
✓ **Fast turnaround** – Most homeowners start within 14 days of approval

I've done hundreds of roofs across Brisbane and Gold Coast, and the #1 regret I hear is: *"I wish I'd done this sooner."*

**Ready to chat?**
- Book a new time: [CALENDAR LINK]
- Or call me direct: 0412 517 411

I'm here to help, no pressure.

Best,
Luke

## Message 3: Social Proof + Last Easy Chance (Day 2)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Quick question about your roof

Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back from you about rescheduling your roof quote call.

Before I close out your file, I wanted to share what Amanda (a Brisbane homeowner like you) told me after we finished her roof:

*"They have been punctual, and so helpful when overcoming problems that have arisen through no fault of their own. The quality of work is amazingly detailed and accurate. We will be using them again and again."*

That's the standard we hold ourselves to – and exactly why we're not your typical roofing contractor.

**No subcontractors. No surprise costs. No patch job fixes.**

Just transparent pricing, licensed professionals, and roofs built to last 20+ years.

**If you're still on the fence, here's my offer:**

Reply to this email with ONE question about your roof, and I'll answer it personally. No strings attached.

Or if you're ready to talk:
**Book here:** [CALENDAR LINK]
**Call me:** 0412 517 411

Your move,
Luke

## Message 4: Final Outreach (Day 5)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Closing your Frost Roofing file – Unless...

Hi [First Name],

This is my last message about your roofing quote.

I tried reaching you for our scheduled call, followed up a few times, but haven't heard back. That's totally fine – I get it.

**I'm closing out your file today**, but wanted to give you one last option:

**If you still need that roof quote**, just reply "YES" and I'll reopen everything. Easy.

**If now's not the right time**, that's cool too. I'll check back with you in 3-6 months to see if anything's changed.

Either way, here's my direct line if you ever need roofing advice: **0412 517 411**

We're a family business serving Brisbane and Gold Coast. Your roof matters to us because our reputation is everything.

Take care,
Luke & Kirby
Frost Roofing

P.S. If you went with another roofer, I hope they treated you right. If not, keep our number handy.

## Implementation Notes

**Timing:**
- Message 1: Within 5 minutes of missed call
- Message 2: 4 hours after missed call
- Message 3: Day 2 (48 hours after missed call)
- Message 4: Day 5 (120 hours after missed call)

**Personalization Variables:**
- [First Name]
- [Phone Number]
- [Time] (of missed appointment)
- [CALENDAR LINK]
- [SHORT LINK]

**Response Handling:**

**"NOT NOW"** = Tag as "Not Ready" and add to 90-day re-engagement list
**"YES"** to Message 4 = Reopen file and send to scheduling
**Question in reply** = Personal response from Luke/team + scheduling offer
**Reschedule booked** = Move back to "Scheduled Call" sequence

**Special Scenarios:**

**Wrong Number:**
If lead replies with "wrong number" or "you have the wrong person":
- Apologize
- Ask for correct number
- Update CRM

**Already Completed:**
If lead says they've already done their roof:
- Thank them
- Ask if they'd leave a review (if they went with Frost)
- Tag as "Customer" or "Lost to Competitor"

**Exit Criteria:**
- Lead reschedules → Back to "Scheduled Call" sequence
- Lead completes preliminary call → Move to appropriate next sequence
- After Message 4 with no response → Pause for 90 days, then gentle re-engagement

**Pro Tips:**
- Keep first follow-up light and non-accusatory
- Build urgency gradually (weather, season)
- Final message should feel like closure but leave door open
- Track "reason for no-show" if lead responds (helps improve scheduling)
