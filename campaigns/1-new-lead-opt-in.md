## Message 2: Value Reminder (Day 3)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** 3 Things That Set Frost Roofing Apart

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my last message about your roofing project.

I get it – replacing a roof is a big decision. You're probably weighing up quotes, checking reviews, and trying to avoid the cowboys out there.

Here's what makes us different:

**1. You talk to us, not a call centre**
It's me and Kirby running the show. Your roof is our reputation.

**2. No quote inflation**
What we quote is what you pay. We've seen too many homeowners burned by surprise costs.

**3. Factory warranty up to 20 years**
We use COLORBOND® steel and stand behind every job. This is your long-term investment, not a patch job.

**Recent example:** Adam from Norman Park
*"Luke and his team were very professional. Takes pride in his work and will go above and beyond with anything asked. My new roof looks awesome."*

Want to see if we're the right fit?

Book your preliminary call here: [CALENDAR LINK]

Or call me directly: 0412 517 411

Best,
Luke

## Message 3: Last Outreach (Day 7)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Last call – Your roof quote is waiting

Hi [First Name],

This is my last email about your roofing project – I don't want to be a pest!

But I wanted to make sure you saw your quote options. With storm season approaching, now's the time to get ahead of Queensland weather.

**Quick reminder:**
- Same-day satellite preliminary quotes
- In-person detailed quotes (no obligation)
- QBCC Licensed & Master Builders QLD
- Typically start within 14 days of approval

If you've already sorted your roof elsewhere, that's great – I hope you chose well.

But if you're still shopping around or have questions, I'm here:

**Book a 10-min call:** [CALENDAR LINK]
**Or just reply** with your questions

We're a small family business, and we treat every roof like it's our own home.

Talk soon,
Luke

P.S. If you're not ready now but want to stay in touch for future roofing needs, reply with "LATER" and I'll check back in a few months.

## Implementation Notes

**Timing:**
- Message 1: 5 minutes after form abandonment
- Message 2: Day 3 (72 hours)
- Message 3: Day 7 (168 hours)

**Personalization Variables:**
- [First Name]
- [CALENDAR LINK] - Calendly or scheduling tool
- [SHORT LINK] - Shortened version of calendar link

**A/B Test Ideas:**
- Subject lines with urgency vs. value
- Luke vs. "Frost Roofing Team" sender name
- Including project photos vs. text-only

**Exit Criteria:**
- Lead books a call (move to "Scheduled Call" sequence)
- Lead completes quiz (different nurture path)
- Lead replies with question (manual follow-up)
- After message 3, pause outreach for 90 days unless re-engagement
