P.S. A few homeowners ask about timing: **Storm season typically hits Oct-March in QLD**. The earlier we book you in, the better protected your family will be when the weather turns.

## Message 2: Value Reinforcement (Day 1 - 24 hours later)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Questions about your [Address] roof quote?

Hi [First Name],

Just checking in on your quote from yesterday.

I know choosing a roofing contractor is a big decision – you're trusting someone with your family's biggest asset.

**Here's why homeowners choose Frost Roofing:**

**✓ What you see is what you get**
Unlike the horror stories you've probably heard, our quote won't magically inflate with "unexpected costs." What we quoted is what you'll pay.

**✓ No subcontractors**
It's our crew, our standards, our reputation on every job. I personally oversee every project.

**✓ Factory warranty up to 20 years**
We use premium COLORBOND® steel and stand behind our work. This isn't a patch job – it's a long-term investment.

**✓ Fast turnaround**
Most contractors will have you waiting months. We typically start within 14 days because we value your time.

**Common questions I get at this stage:**

**Q: "Is this price negotiable?"**
A: Our pricing is transparent and fair. We're not playing games or leaving room for haggling. What we've quoted is our best work at our best price.

**Q: "What if it rains during the job?"**
A: We have weather protection protocols and adjust our schedule accordingly. Your home stays protected throughout.

**Q: "Do you offer payment plans?"**
A: [INSERT YOUR PAYMENT/FINANCING OPTIONS]

**Ready to lock in your start date?**
Reply YES and I'll send over the deposit details to secure your spot.

Best,

## Message 3: Social Proof + Urgency (Day 3)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** How soon do you want to start? (Your [Address] roof)

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to follow up on your quote – our schedule is filling up fast for the next few weeks.

**Right now I have:**
- 2 spots available in [Month 1]
- 4 spots available in [Month 2]
- After that, we're booking into [Month 3]

The closer we get to storm season, the busier we get. Most homeowners realize they need a new roof *after* the first storm hits – which means they're dealing with leaks, tarps, and delays while they wait.

**You're ahead of the game by planning now.**

**What our customers say about timing:**

Amanda (Brisbane): *"We will be using them again and again."*

Adam (Gold Coast): *"Takes pride in his work and will go above and beyond with anything asked. My new roof looks awesome."*

Both of them chose to move forward quickly and were protected before storm season hit.

**Want to secure your spot?**

**Option 1:** Reply YES and I'll send deposit details
**Option 2:** Call me to discuss: 0412 517 411
**Option 3:** Need more time? Let me know when to follow up

I respect whatever decision you make, but I don't want you to miss out on your preferred timeline.

Talk soon,
Luke

## Message 4: Last Outreach + Objection Handling (Day 7)

### EMAIL
**Subject:** Last check-in: Your Frost Roofing quote

Hi [First Name],

This is my last message about your roof quote (unless you'd like me to follow up).

I haven't heard back from you, and that usually means one of three things:

**1. You're still thinking it over**
Totally fair. Big decision. If you need more time, just let me know when to check back.

**2. You've chosen another contractor**
No hard feelings – I hope they do right by you. If anything goes sideways, you know where to find us.

**3. The price is a concern**
Look, I get it. Roofing isn't cheap. But cutting corners now often costs more later (patch jobs, water damage, mold, reduced property value).

If budget is the issue, let's talk. I might be able to adjust the timeline or payment structure. Worth a conversation.

**Here's what I know:**

After 20+ years in this industry, I've seen homeowners make two types of decisions:

✗ **Short-term thinking:** Go with the cheapest quote, deal with problems later
✓ **Long-term thinking:** Invest in quality once, protect their family for decades

We built Frost Roofing for the second group.

**The ball's in your court:**

- **Ready to proceed?** Reply YES
- **Have questions?** Call me: 0412 517 411
- **Need time?** Tell me when to follow up
- **Went another direction?** Reply "ALL SET" and I'll wish you well

Whatever you choose, I respect your decision.

Best,
Luke & Kirby
Frost Roofing

P.S. If you're price shopping, remember: **The cheapest quote usually isn't the best deal**. Ask about licenses, insurance, warranties, and who's actually doing the work. Those are the questions that separate the pros from the cowboys.
